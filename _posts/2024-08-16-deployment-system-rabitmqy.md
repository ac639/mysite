## What is it?

A linux targeted bundling system that bundles and transfers your code across multiple devices on the same network and logs bundle versions and whether or not they pass 
on from QA testing to production. There is no "central" program, rather modular PHP and bash script files. 

## Requirements

- RabbitMQ
- PHP

## How to Use

- Self explanatory, run mkbundle.sh first
