<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    I love to tinker, break things (intentially), and figure out how they work. Building, maintaining, 
    and optimizing systems is my passion, with reliability, uptime, and customer satisfaction as the ultimate goals. 
    My work carries my name, and I take pride in delivering solutions that just workâ€”and keep working.
</p>
<p>
    I have spent most of my career maintining and providing support for Windows and Linux based systems for general
    business producitivity needs. I dabble in programming whenever I see the chance to improve something,
    mostly in Bash/PHP and Powershell but I also know my way around Java and like to build my own projects.
</p>   
    Outside of work I like fixing cars and trying different open source languages/toolkits. When I was very young
    I used to play on Roblox, picked up how to script in Lua, and made a few profitable games by
    the time I entered my first year in college.

<p> <br> I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from NJIT and am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science.
